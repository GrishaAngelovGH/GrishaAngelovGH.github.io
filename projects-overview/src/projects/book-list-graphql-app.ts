      This is a full-stack application featuring a dynamic book list, developed using GraphQL and Apollo Client to enable interaction with book data. 
      It allows users to browse a list of books, add new entries to the list, 
      and view detailed information about a selected book, including its author's other works. 
      Additionally, users can delete books directly, ensuring efficient management of the book list.

      <div><span class="fw-bold">Frontend:</span> Built with ReactJS and Apollo Client, providing an interactive user interface and integration with GraphQL for data interaction</div>
