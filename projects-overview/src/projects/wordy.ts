      This front-end project is an implementation of the popular word puzzle game Wordle, 
      designed to offer an interactive and engaging gaming experience. 
      Players are tasked with guessing a hidden word within a limited number of attempts, 
      with the game providing instant feedback by highlighting letters based on their correctness and placement. 
      The grid-based layout dynamically adjusts to reflect the playerâ€™s progress, with color-coded feedback guiding each guess.
