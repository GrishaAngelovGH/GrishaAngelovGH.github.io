    <div class="text-justify">
      Front-end project implementing handwritten digit recognition based on tensorflow.js - a library that allows you to develop Machine Learning Models in JavaScript and use Machine Learning directly in the browser or in Node.js.
      This project uses predefined high accuracy data model (<a href="https://github.com/avinashkranjan/Amazing-Python-Scripts/tree/main/Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition/models">freely available on github</a>)
      The data model is generated with python script and is based on MNIST dataset that is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
